== Description ==

Standalone solution for publishing and reading web fictions.

== Privacy ==

Fictioneer uses Web Storage to save settings and store information voluntarily provided by the user, such as site customizations and bookmarks. Web Storage is necessary for the site to work properly but does not contain user-specific data until the user opts to change settings or log in, which are informed and deliberate actions. Anything up to this point are default values.
